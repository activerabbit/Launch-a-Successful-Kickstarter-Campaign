# Launch-a-Successful-Kickstarter-Campaign
Machine Learning to Measure Successfulness of Kickstarter Campaign

Crowdfunding platforms have gained incredible momentum in the past decade for seamlessly funding personal projects. Kickstarter is the most prominent and unique crowdfunding platform where creators design the layouts, set the time frames and establish funding goals for their campaigns. If, otherwise, donors do not contribute enough to meet the goal, the campaign is considered failed and the fund is not delivered. Therefore, launching a successful campaign is critical to fund seekers and their delivery of their projects. This project is an attempt to understand features that lead to successful campaigns and utilize machine learning to predict the outcomes of campaigns. The best model achieved a 73.7% accuracy
